    "text": "Following the February 2024 investigation into Listeria monocytogenes contamination linked to Queso Fresco and Cotija cheeseüßÄ, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of Listeria outbreaks over a 12-year period, focusing on the key trends and environments that drive these outbreaks.\nListeria monocytogenes (or L. monocytogenes) is a type of bacteria that can make you sick. It hangs out in places like soil, water, decaying plants, animals, and damp areas.\nYou usually pick up L. monocytogenes when food is handled or stored in places where the bacteria is present, like during harvesting, processing, or transporting. It can spread through things like raw materials, water, soil, or even the air. source\nPets can also bring the bacteria into your home if they eat contaminated food.\nWhat makes it tricky is that it can survive and even grow in the fridge, so it‚Äôs not always easy to get rid of. If you eat food contaminated with this bacteria, you might develop an illness called listeriosis.\nImage Source: FDA.gov\nAs part of my hands-on learning experience at Broadstreet Institute, I conducted an in-depth study of Listeria outbreak-related fatalities from 2009 to 2021. My project sought to uncover trends and pinpoint the environments most associated with Listeria monocytogenes.\nTo achieve these insights, I extensively utilized SAS programming for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, transforming raw data into meaningful patterns."

    "text": "Background Info:\nIn 2021, around a third of US births were C-sections, a surgical procedure even for low-risk cases. Unnecessary C-sections can harm mothers and babies more than natural births. Overuse is due to differing medical practices and a casual approach to surgery.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found slow labor progression to be a common reason for first-time C-sections. Encouraging natural births for low-risk women could reduce these unnecessary procedures, improving health outcomes."

However, the low R-squared value suggests that the majority of the variance in the birth rate cannot be explained.\nThe age of the mother has a significant impact on birth rate (F = 8.89, p &lt; .0001), meaning birth rates likely vary across different age groups. Similarly, mother‚Äôs race also significantly affects birth rate (F = 21.96, p &lt; .0001), suggesting birth rates differ among racial groups. However, the number of prenatal visits doesn‚Äôt appear to be a meaningful predictor here (p = 0.9957), as it doesn‚Äôt show any significant influence on birth rate."

    "text": "This Excel project used:\n\npower query\ncreating a combo chart\nslicers\ndynamic text boxes\n\nFor this, I grabbed some data on stroke hospitalizations in Texas counties. I used the Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke to pull ‚Äúall stroke‚Äù data for 2018-2020, focusing on folks 65 and older. I applied filters for all racial and ethnic groups, and I ran them separately for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes.\n\n\n\nMapping Tool, source: https://nccd.cdc.gov/\n\n\nThen, I opened Excel and copied the data from the site straight into a spreadsheet. I set up separate worksheets for all strokes, ischemic strokes, and hemorrhagic strokes. After that, I used Excel‚Äôs Power Query to combine all the data tables into one. I named it ‚Äúcombinedtable,‚Äù closed it, and loaded it into a new worksheet to keep things tidy.\nTo make things visually pop, I highlighted the state of Texas on the map, drawing attention to the fact that the average stroke hospitalization rate among Medicare beneficiaries nationwide is 10.7 per 1,000. At the same time, Texas sits slightly higher at 11.8 per 1,000. The combo chart I made showed that nearly half (45%) of all counties in Texas have stroke hospitalization rates above the state average for Medicare beneficiaries. I also added a slicer so you can choose a specific county and see how it affects the chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the bottom of the dashboard, there‚Äôs a text box with a key stat: 87% of reported strokes were ischemic (2,187 cases), and the other 13% were hemorrhagic (341 cases).\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, these visualizations and data help paint a clear picture of how stroke hospitalizations vary across Texas. Understanding these differences can guide more targeted healthcare interventions and help allocate resources where needed most. It‚Äôs fascinating to see how much insight data like this can provide!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub Repository"

I wanted to understand patterns across demographics, manufacturers, and event categories like hospitalizations, deaths, and emergency visits.\nTo do this, I built a Power BI dashboard that highlights:\n\nTop states with the highest number of reported adverse events.\nManufacturers with the most reports.\nYear-over-year trends and event categories.\n\nWhy? Because data-driven insights like these can help public health experts and vaccine makers improve safety and communication efforts."

    "text": "How I Made It Happen\n\n1. Starting with the Data\nI pulled data from the CDC WONDER database, which is an incredible (and free!) resource for public health info. Here‚Äôs how I tackled it:\n\nFirst, I filtered the dataset by gender‚Äîone for male reports and another for female reports.\nI downloaded the data as text files for each group.\n\n\n\n2. Prepping the Data\nNext, I turned to Excel‚Äôs Power Query tool to clean and combine the data:\n\nImported the male and female files into separate tables.\nAdded a column to each table to label gender.\nCreated another column to identify the country (spoiler: it‚Äôs all U.S. data).\nAppended the male and female tables into one final dataset, saving it as an Excel file for Power BI.\n\nThis gave me a clean, unified dataset ready to analyze.\n\n\n3. Building the Dashboard\nNow for the fun part‚Äîturning the data into visuals that make sense at a glance:\n\nMap Visualization: Showcased the top 10 states with the most adverse events.\nBar and Column Charts:\n\nOne chart displayed event counts by year, showing trends from 2019 to 2024.\nAnother broke down event counts by manufacturer.\n\nData Table: A detailed view of event categories and their counts.\n\nThe dashboard isn‚Äôt just pretty‚Äîit‚Äôs interactive. You can filter it by demographics, years, and event types to explore the story from different angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the Numbers Are Saying\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nEmergency Care Dominates\nMost of the reports (513!) were about emergency room or office visits. These events are urgent but usually not life-threatening, making this category the biggest slice of the pie.\nMerck & Co., Inc.¬†Tops the Manufacturer List\nWith 157 adverse events reported, Merck leads the pack. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean their vaccines are riskier‚Äîit could be tied to how often their vaccines are used.\n2019 Stands Out\nOver half (52.57%) of all reports came from 2019. Was it a big vaccination push? A change in reporting practices? That‚Äôs worth digging into.\nCalifornia Leads the States\nAmong the top 10 states, California reported the highest number of events (37), followed by Florida (33) and Ohio (30).\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nProjects like this aren‚Äôt just about crunching numbers‚Äîthey‚Äôre about using data to make smarter decisions. Public health experts can use insights like these to:\n\nInvestigate trends in high-reporting states.\nDig deeper into manufacturers with more reports to identify opportunities for improvement.\nReassure the public that the vast majority of adverse events aren‚Äôt severe.\n\n\n\nThe Takeaway\nThis project was all about turning complex vaccine data into something that‚Äôs easy to understand and explore. Whether it‚Äôs identifying trends, pinpointing areas of concern, or just presenting the data in a user-friendly way, dashboards like this help bridge the gap between raw numbers and actionable insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub Repository"

    "text": "Following the February 2024 investigation into Listeria monocytogenes contamination linked to Queso Fresco and Cotija cheese🧀, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of Listeria outbreaks over a 12-year period, focusing on the key trends and environments that drive these outbreaks.\nListeria monocytogenes (or L. monocytogenes) is a type of bacteria that can make you sick. It hangs out in places like soil, water, decaying plants, animals, and damp areas.\nYou usually pick up L. monocytogenes when food is handled or stored in places where the bacteria is present, like during harvesting, processing, or transporting. It can spread through things like raw materials, water, soil, or even the air. source\nPets can also bring the bacteria into your home if they eat contaminated food.\nWhat makes it tricky is that it can survive and even grow in the fridge, so it’s not always easy to get rid of. If you eat food contaminated with this bacteria, you might develop an illness called listeriosis.\nImage Source: FDA.gov\nAs part of my hands-on learning experience at Broadstreet Institute, I conducted an in-depth study of Listeria outbreak-related fatalities from 2009 to 2021. My project sought to uncover trends and pinpoint the environments most associated with Listeria monocytogenes.\nTo achieve these insights, I extensively utilized SAS programming for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, transforming raw data into meaningful patterns."

I applied filters for all racial and ethnic groups, and I ran them separately for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes.\nThen, I opened Excel and copied the data from the site straight into a spreadsheet.

I named it “combinedtable,” closed it, and loaded it into a new worksheet to keep things tidy.\nTo make things visually pop, I highlighted the state of Texas on the map, drawing attention to the fact that the average stroke hospitalization rate among Medicare beneficiaries nationwide is 10.7 per 1,000. At the same time, Texas sits slightly higher at 11.8 per 1,000.

Understanding these differences can guide more targeted healthcare interventions and help allocate resources where needed most. It’s fascinating to see how much insight data like this can provide!"

    "text": "Background Info:\nIn 2021, around a third of US births were C-sections, a surgical procedure even for low-risk cases. Unnecessary C-sections can harm mothers and babies more than natural births. Overuse is due to differing medical practices and a casual approach to surgery.\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found slow labor progression to be a common reason for first-time C-sections. Encouraging natural births for low-risk women could reduce these unnecessary procedures, improving health outcomes."

    "text": "Step 4: Use Proc GLM to model Birth Rate as a continuous dependent variable, and include the independent variables (Age of Mother, Visits Code, and Mother Rate)\nproc glm data=cdelivery;\n   class Mother_Race Age_of_Mother;     *categorical variables;\n   model Birth_Rate = Age_of_Mother Visits_Code Mother_Race;   *Main effects model;\n   means Age_of_Mother / tukey;    *Post-hoc tests to check significant differences \n                                    between age groups;\nrun;\n\n\n\n^^GLM procedure Output^^\n\n\n\nSo what does the model tell us about observing the age of mother, the mother’s race and the number of prenatal visits for predicting cesarean birth rates?\nThe model explains less than 5% of the variation in cesarean birth rates, according to its R-Square of 4.47%.The difference in birth rates is not well supported by the factors I selected from the dataset: the mother’s age, race, and number of prenatal visits.\nWith a p-value &lt;.0001, the model is statistically significant overall, indicating that these predictors collectively have a meaningful relationship with the birth rate. However, the low R-squared value suggests that the majority of the variance in the birth rate cannot be explained.\nThe age of the mother has a significant impact on birth rate (F = 8.89, p &lt; .0001), meaning birth rates likely vary across different age groups. Similarly, mother’s race also significantly affects birth rate (F = 21.96, p &lt; .0001), suggesting birth rates differ among racial groups. However, the number of prenatal visits doesn’t appear to be a meaningful predictor here (p = 0.9957), as it doesn’t show any significant influence on birth rate."

    "text": "This Excel project used:\n\npower query\ncreating a combo chart\nslicers\ndynamic text boxes\n\nFor this, I grabbed some data on stroke hospitalizations in Texas counties. I used the Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke to pull “all stroke” data for 2018-2020, focusing on folks 65 and older. I applied filters for all racial and ethnic groups, and I ran them separately for hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes.\n\n\n\nMapping Tool, source: https://nccd.cdc.gov/\n\n\nThen, I opened Excel and copied the data from the site straight into a spreadsheet. I set up separate worksheets for all strokes, ischemic strokes, and hemorrhagic strokes. After that, I used Excel’s Power Query to combine all the data tables into one. I named it “combinedtable,” closed it, and loaded it into a new worksheet to keep things tidy.\nTo make things visually pop, I highlighted the state of Texas on the map, drawing attention to the fact that the average stroke hospitalization rate among Medicare beneficiaries nationwide is 10.7 per 1,000. At the same time, Texas sits slightly higher at 11.8 per 1,000. The combo chart I made showed that nearly half (45%) of all counties in Texas have stroke hospitalization rates above the state average for Medicare beneficiaries. I also added a slicer so you can choose a specific county and see how it affects the chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the bottom of the dashboard, there’s a text box with a key stat: 87% of reported strokes were ischemic (2,187 cases), and the other 13% were hemorrhagic (341 cases).\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, these visualizations and data help paint a clear picture of how stroke hospitalizations vary across Texas. Understanding these differences can guide more targeted healthcare interventions and help allocate resources where needed most. It’s fascinating to see how much insight data like this can provide!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub Repository"

I wanted to understand patterns across demographics, manufacturers, and event categories like hospitalizations, deaths, and emergency visits.\nTo do this, I built a Power BI dashboard that highlights:\n\nTop states with the highest number of reported adverse events.\nManufacturers with the most reports.\nYear-over-year trends and event categories.\n\nWhy? Because data-driven insights like these can help public health experts and vaccine makers improve safety and communication efforts."

    "section": "How I Made It Happen",
    "text": "How I Made It Happen\n\n1. Starting with the Data\nI pulled data from the CDC WONDER database, which is an incredible (and free!) resource for public health info. Here’s how I tackled it:\n\nFirst, I filtered the dataset by gender—one for male reports and another for female reports.\nI downloaded the data as text files for each group.\n\n\n\n2. Prepping the Data\nNext, I turned to Excel’s Power Query tool to clean and combine the data:\n\nImported the male and female files into separate tables.\nAdded a column to each table to label gender.\nCreated another column to identify the country (spoiler: it’s all U.S. data).\nAppended the male and female tables into one final dataset, saving it as an Excel file for Power BI.\n\nThis gave me a clean, unified dataset ready to analyze.\n\n\n3. Building the Dashboard\nNow for the fun part—turning the data into visuals that make sense at a glance:\n\nMap Visualization: Showcased the top 10 states with the most adverse events.\nBar and Column Charts:\n\nOne chart displayed event counts by year, showing trends from 2019 to 2024.\nAnother broke down event counts by manufacturer.\n\nData Table: A detailed view of event categories and their counts.\n\nThe dashboard isn’t just pretty—it’s interactive. You can filter it by demographics, years, and event types to explore the story from different angles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the Numbers Are Saying\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nEmergency Care Dominates\nMost of the reports (513!) were about emergency room or office visits. These events are urgent but usually not life-threatening, making this category the biggest slice of the pie.\nMerck & Co., Inc. Tops the Manufacturer List\nWith 157 adverse events reported, Merck leads the pack. This doesn’t necessarily mean their vaccines are riskier—it could be tied to how often their vaccines are used.\n2019 Stands Out\nOver half (52.57%) of all reports came from 2019. Was it a big vaccination push? A change in reporting practices? That’s worth digging into.\nCalifornia Leads the States\nAmong the top 10 states, California reported the highest number of events (37), followed by Florida (33) and Ohio (30).\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nProjects like this aren’t just about crunching numbers—they’re about using data to make smarter decisions. Public health experts can use insights like these to:\n\nInvestigate trends in high-reporting states.\nDig deeper into manufacturers with more reports to identify opportunities for improvement.\nReassure the public that the vast majority of adverse events aren’t severe.\n\n\n\nThe Takeaway\nThis project was all about turning complex vaccine data into something that’s easy to understand and explore. Whether it’s identifying trends, pinpointing areas of concern, or just presenting the data in a user-friendly way, dashboards like this help bridge the gap between raw numbers and actionable insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGithub Repository"

Is there a consistent rise or dip, or any unusual trends?\nHealthcare organizations can determine where costs are increasing unnecessarily or where cost-effective care is being provided by examining the average claim amounts over time for various provider specialties.\n\n## Aggregate the claimamount column to calculate the average claim amount per provider specialty\n\n## use the pipe operator to take the output and pass it on as the first argument into the function on the right.\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\ntrend &lt;- claimsdata %&gt;% \n  mutate(Year= year(ClaimDate)) %&gt;%       ## create the year column\n  group_by(ProviderSpecialty, Year) %&gt;%   ## group by specialty and year\n  summarize(AvgClaim = mean(ClaimAmount, na.rm = TRUE))  ## average claim amount by specialty and year, remove nulls\n         \nhead(trend)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   ProviderSpecialty [2]\n  ProviderSpecialty  Year AvgClaim\n  &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Cardiology         2022    4914.\n2 Cardiology         2023    5107.\n3 Cardiology         2024    4929.\n4 General Practice   2022    5028.\n5 General Practice   2023    4980.\n6 General Practice   2024    4941.\n\n## Create the line graph with all specialties\nggplot(trend, aes(x = Year, y = AvgClaim, color = ProviderSpecialty)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + \n  labs(title = \"Trend of Average Claim Amount by Specialty\",\n       x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Average Claim Amount in USD\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) ## Rotate x-axis labels for readability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll specialties have a downward trend except Pediatrics. The average claim amount for providers specializing in Pediatrics seems to be increasing from 2022 to 2024. I wonder if these results are expected?\nA consistent rise in claim amounts for Pediatrics could be due to factors like changes in the cost of pediatric procedures, new medical treatments, or increased demand for pediatric services. However, it could also raise concerns about potential issues like over-billing or unnecessary procedures, which would need further investigation.\n\n\nLet’s keep going onto our second metric.\nFinancial impact of denied claims by Specialty (total $ amount of denied claims/ total $ of claims for each specialty)\nWhile less than 5% is ideal, the industry average denial rate ranges from 5% to 10%. The goal for providers should be to settle 85% of denials in 30 days or less. (source: hfma.com)\n\nDenialRates &lt;- claimsdata %&gt;% \n  mutate(Year= year(ClaimDate), Month= month(ClaimDate)) %&gt;% \n  filter(Year == 2024) %&gt;% \n  group_by(ProviderSpecialty, Month) %&gt;% \n  summarize(\n    Total_ClaimAmount = sum(ClaimAmount, na.rm = TRUE),  ## Sum of all claims for each specialty\n    Denied_ClaimAmount = sum(ClaimAmount[ClaimStatus == \"Denied\"], na.rm = TRUE),\n    Percentage = round(Denied_ClaimAmount/ Total_ClaimAmount * 100,2)\n    ) ## Sum of denied claims for each specialty\n\nview(DenialRates)\n\nLet’s visualize the DenialRates with a scatterplot for the most current year, 2024.\n\nggplot(DenialRates, aes(x= as.factor(Month), y= Percentage, color = ProviderSpecialty)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Percentage of Denied Claims by Provider Specialty 2024\") +\n  xlab(\"Month\") + ylab(\"Percentage\") +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10)) +  ## Y-axis increments by 1\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"1\" = \"Jan\", \"2\" = \"Feb\", \"3\" = \"Mar\", \"4\" = \"Apr\", \"5\" = \"May\", \"6\" = \"Jun\", \"7\" = \"Jul\", \"8\" = \"Aug\", \"9\" = \"Sep\", \"10\" = \"Oct\", \"11\" = \"Nov\", \"12\" = \"Dec\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow! For the entire year of 2024, the General Practice specialty was the only specialty to meet the industry standard in July. Cardiology was consistently higher compared to the other specialties from April through July of 2024.\nI wonder what practices General practice was implementing for July of 2024, and how to implement them into the other specialties?\n\n\nLet’s keep going onto our third and final metric.\nTrends in claims submissions to see which are more successful. Cost per claim submission method (paper, online [electronic] or phone) and claim status (approved, denied and pending)\n95% is the industry standard benchmark- this implies that at least 95% of claims should be submitted electronically by healthcare providers. Because electronic claim filing is quicker, more accurate, and less expensive than paper-based submissions. (source: MD Clarity)\n\n## group data by provider specialty and claim submission methods \n\nclaims_status_by_method &lt;- claimsdata %&gt;%\n  filter(ClaimStatus== \"Approved\" | ClaimStatus== \"Denied\") %&gt;% \n  group_by(ClaimSubmissionMethod, ClaimStatus) %&gt;%\n  summarize(ClaimCount = n()) %&gt;%             ##  counts for each group.\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  group_by(ClaimSubmissionMethod) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Percentage = round(ClaimCount / sum(ClaimCount) * 100, 2)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(ClaimSubmissionMethod, -Percentage)  ## see which status is more prevalent for each submission method\n\n# View the calculated table\nprint(claims_status_by_method)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n# Groups:   ClaimSubmissionMethod [3]\n  ClaimSubmissionMethod ClaimStatus ClaimCount Percentage\n  &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Online                Denied             525       52.2\n2 Online                Approved           480       47.8\n3 Paper                 Approved           524       50.6\n4 Paper                 Denied             511       49.4\n5 Phone                 Approved           518       52.1\n6 Phone                 Denied             476       47.9\n\n\nThe percentages are calculated within each submission method (so for “Online”, the total is 525 + 480 = 1005 claims, and the percentages are based on that total).\nThe analysis shows that even while online submissions are faster and less expensive, they still have a high rejection rate (52.2%).\nThe Paper method of submitting a claim has the highest chance of being approved.I wonder if there is a possibility that online submissions have stricter review processes, leading to more denials?"

    "text": "In Summary\nOrganizations can modify care models, promote evidence-based practices, and enhance patient outcomes by identifying inefficient or expensive care trends (such as overutilization in particular specialties).\nSpecific operational inefficiencies (such as high denial rates for electronic claims) can be identified with the use of metrics like denial rates and submission techniques. These inefficiencies can then be fixed by process optimization, improved tools, or training."

    "text": "Following the February 2024 investigation into Listeria monocytogenes contamination linked to Queso Fresco and Cotija cheese🧀, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of Listeria outbreaks over a 12-year period, focusing on the key trends and environments that drive these outbreaks.\nListeria monocytogenes (or L. monocytogenes) is a type of bacteria that can make you sick. It hangs out in places like soil, water, decaying plants, animals, and damp areas.\nYou usually pick up L. monocytogenes when food is handled or stored in places where the bacteria is present, like during harvesting, processing, or transporting. It can spread through things like raw materials, water, soil, or even the air. source\nPets can also bring the bacteria into your home if they eat contaminated food.\nWhat makes it tricky is that it can survive and even grow in the fridge, so it’s not always easy to get rid of. If you eat food contaminated with this bacteria, you might develop an illness called listeriosis.\nImage Source: FDA.gov\nAs part of my hands-on learning experience at Broadstreet Institute, I conducted an in-depth study of Listeria outbreak-related fatalities from 2009 to 2021. My project sought to uncover trends and pinpoint the environments most associated with Listeria monocytogenes.\nTo achieve these insights, I extensively utilized SAS programming for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, transforming raw data into meaningful patterns."

These observations can direct public health initiatives and regulations to lessen the effects of Listeria outbreaks.\nBut why is the setting for exposure highest among private homes or residences?"
